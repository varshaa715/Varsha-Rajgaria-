Hello and welcome! ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for stopping by my GitHub! Iâ€™m on an exciting journey of building my skills as an Analystâ€”bringing together my background in commerce and marketing with a growing focus on business insights, reporting, and problem-solving. My goal is to explore how business knowledge, structured thinking, and clear communication come together to support better decision-making.

Hereâ€™s what you can explore here:

ðŸ“Š Reports & dashboards Iâ€™ve created to track KPIs, monitor performance, and make information easier to interpret

ðŸ“š Learning projects where I practice tools like Excel, SQL, and Power BI to organize data and highlight meaningful patterns

ðŸ’¡ Business insights & experiments where I apply analytical thinking to real-world scenarios and sharpen my problem-solving approach

This space is all about sharing my learning journey, process, and passion for turning numbers into meaningful stories. I believe that analysis is not just about calculationsâ€”itâ€™s about asking the right questions, finding clarity, and creating solutions that help businesses grow.

If youâ€™re interested in analysis, business problem-solving, or simplifying complex informationâ€”stick around, we might have a lot in common!

Letâ€™s keep learning and building together ðŸš€
